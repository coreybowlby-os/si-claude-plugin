**The performance optimization system for AI agent harnesses.**

Not just configs. A complete system: skills, instincts, memory optimization, continuous learning, security scanning, and research-first development. Production-ready agents, skills, hooks, rules, MCP configurations, and legacy command shims evolved over 10+ months of intensive daily use building real products.

Works across **Claude Code**, **Codex**, **Cursor**, **OpenCode**, **Gemini**, and other AI agent harnesses.

## Guides

The in-repo guides cover each major topic in depth:

- [`the-shortform-guide.md`](the-shortform-guide.md) — Setup, foundations, philosophy. **Read this first.**
- [`the-longform-guide.md`](the-longform-guide.md) — Token optimization, memory persistence, evals, parallelization.
- [`the-security-guide.md`](the-security-guide.md) — Attack vectors, sandboxing, sanitization, security patterns.

| Topic | What You'll Learn |
|-------|-------------------|
| Token Optimization | Model selection, system prompt slimming, background processes |
| Memory Persistence | Hooks that save/load context across sessions automatically |
| Continuous Learning | Auto-extract patterns from sessions into reusable skills |
| Verification Loops | Checkpoint vs continuous evals, grader types, pass@k metrics |
| Parallelization | Git worktrees, cascade method, when to scale instances |
| Subagent Orchestration | The context problem, iterative retrieval pattern |

## Quick Start

Get up and running in under 2 minutes:

### Step 1: Install the Plugin

> NOTE: The plugin is convenient, but the OSS installer below is still the most reliable path if your Claude Code build has trouble resolving self-hosted marketplace entries.

```bash
# Add marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/coreybowlby-os/SI-Claude-Plugin

# Install plugin
/plugin install SI-Claude-Plugin@SI-Claude-Plugin
```

### Step 2: Install Rules and Hooks

Rules and hook scripts are now **automatically kept in sync** by the `session-start-plugin-sync.js` hook included in this plugin. On every session start, the hook checks whether the installed plugin version has changed and, if so, re-runs `install-apply.js` to reinstall all SICP artifacts (rules, hooks, skills) into `~/.claude/` automatically.

For your first install, or to install manually at any time:

```bash
# Clone the repo first
git clone https://github.com/coreybowlby-os/SI-Claude-Plugin.git
cd SI-Claude-Plugin

# Install dependencies (pick your package manager)
npm install        # or: pnpm install | yarn install | bun install

# macOS/Linux

# Recommended: install everything (full profile)
./install.sh --profile full

# Or install for specific languages only
./install.sh typescript    # or python or golang or swift or php
# ./install.sh typescript python golang swift php
# ./install.sh --target cursor typescript
# ./install.sh --target antigravity typescript
# ./install.sh --target gemini --profile full
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell

# Recommended: install everything (full profile)
.\install.ps1 --profile full

# Or install for specific languages only
.\install.ps1 typescript   # or python or golang or swift or php
# .\install.ps1 typescript python golang swift php
# .\install.ps1 --target cursor typescript
# .\install.ps1 --target antigravity typescript
# .\install.ps1 --target gemini --profile full

# npm-installed compatibility entrypoint also works cross-platform
npx sicp-install typescript
```

For manual install instructions see the README in the `rules/` folder. When copying rules manually, copy the whole language directory (for example `rules/common` or `rules/golang`), not the files inside it, so relative references keep working and filenames do not collide.

### Step 3: Start Using

```bash
# Skills are the primary workflow surface.
# Existing slash-style command names still work while SICP migrates off commands/.

# Plugin install uses the namespaced form
/SICP:plan "Add user authentication"

# Manual install keeps the shorter slash form:
# /plan "Add user authentication"

# Check available commands
/plugin list SI-Claude-Plugin@SI-Claude-Plugin
```

**That's it!** You now have access to 47 agents, 195 skills, and 79 legacy command shims.

### Multi-model commands require additional setup

> WARNING: `multi-*` commands are **not** covered by the base plugin/rules install above.
>
> To use `/multi-plan`, `/multi-execute`, `/multi-backend`, `/multi-frontend`, and `/multi-workflow`, you must also install the `ccg-workflow` runtime.
>
> Initialize it with `npx ccg-workflow`.
>
> That runtime provides the external dependencies these commands expect, including:
> - `~/.claude/bin/codeagent-wrapper`
> - `~/.claude/.ccg/prompts/*`
>
> Without `ccg-workflow`, these `multi-*` commands will not run correctly.

## Cross-Platform Support

This plugin now fully supports **Windows, macOS, and Linux**, alongside tight integration across major IDEs (Cursor, OpenCode, Antigravity) and CLI harnesses. All hooks and scripts have been rewritten in Node.js for maximum compatibility.

### Package Manager Detection

The plugin automatically detects your preferred package manager (npm, pnpm, yarn, or bun) with the following priority:

1. **Environment variable**: `CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER`
2. **Project config**: `.claude/package-manager.json`
3. **package.json**: `packageManager` field
4. **Lock file**: Detection from package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb
5. **Global config**: `~/.claude/package-manager.json`
6. **Fallback**: First available package manager

To set your preferred package manager:

```bash
# Via environment variable
export CLAUDE_PACKAGE_MANAGER=pnpm

# Via global config
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --global pnpm

# Via project config
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --project bun

# Detect current setting
node scripts/setup-package-manager.js --detect
```

Or use the `/setup-pm` command in Claude Code.

### Hook Runtime Controls

Use runtime flags to tune strictness or disable specific hooks temporarily:

```bash
# Hook strictness profile (default: standard)
export ECC_HOOK_PROFILE=standard

# Comma-separated hook IDs to disable
export ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS="pre:bash:tmux-reminder,post:edit:standards"
```

## Ecosystem Tools

### Skill Creator

Two ways to generate Claude Code skills from your repository:

#### Option A: Local Analysis (Built-in)

Use the `/skill-create` command for local analysis without external services:

```bash
/skill-create                    # Analyze current repo
/skill-create --instincts        # Also generate instincts for continuous-learning
```

This analyzes your git history locally and generates SKILL.md files.

The local analysis creates:
- **SKILL.md files** - Ready-to-use skills for Claude Code
- **Instinct collections** - For continuous-learning-v2
- **Pattern extraction** - Learns from your commit history

### Continuous Learning v2

The instinct-based learning system automatically learns your patterns:

```bash
/instinct-status        # Show learned instincts with confidence
/instinct-import <file> # Import instincts from others
/instinct-export        # Export your instincts for sharing
/evolve                 # Cluster related instincts into skills
```

See `skills/continuous-learning-v2/` for full documentation.

## Requirements

### Claude Code CLI Version

**Minimum version: v2.1.0 or later**

This plugin requires Claude Code CLI v2.1.0+ due to changes in how the plugin system handles hooks.

Check your version:
```bash
claude --version
```

### Important: Hooks Auto-Loading Behavior

> WARNING: **For Contributors:** Do NOT add a `"hooks"` field to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. This is enforced by a regression test.

Claude Code v2.1+ **automatically loads** `hooks/hooks.json` from any installed plugin by convention. Explicitly declaring it in `plugin.json` causes a duplicate detection error:

```
Duplicate hooks file detected: ./hooks/hooks.json resolves to already-loaded file
```

---

## Installation

### Install as Plugin

The easiest way to use this repo - install as a Claude Code plugin:

```bash
# Add this repo as a marketplace
/plugin marketplace add https://github.com/coreybowlby-os/SI-Claude-Plugin

# Install the plugin
/plugin install SI-Claude-Plugin@SI-Claude-Plugin
```

Or add directly to your `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "extraKnownMarketplaces": {
    "SI-Claude-Plugin": {
      "source": {
        "source": "github",
        "repo": "coreybowlby-os/SI-Claude-Plugin"
      }
    }
  },
  "enabledPlugins": {
    "SI-Claude-Plugin@SI-Claude-Plugin": true
  }
}
```

This gives you instant access to all commands, agents, skills, and hooks.

> **Note:** Rules, hooks, and skills are automatically reinstalled on every session start by the `session-start-plugin-sync.js` hook (included in this plugin). If you prefer to install manually or on first setup:
>
> ```bash
> # Clone the repo first
> git clone https://github.com/coreybowlby-os/SI-Claude-Plugin.git
>
> # Option A: Automated install (recommended — installs rules, hooks, skills, and agents)
> cd SI-Claude-Plugin
> npm install
> node scripts/install-apply.js --target claude --profile core
>
> # Option B: Manual rules install — user-level (applies to all projects)
> mkdir -p ~/.claude/rules
> cp -r SI-Claude-Plugin/rules/common ~/.claude/rules/
> cp -r SI-Claude-Plugin/rules/typescript ~/.claude/rules/   # pick your stack
> cp -r SI-Claude-Plugin/rules/python ~/.claude/rules/
> cp -r SI-Claude-Plugin/rules/golang ~/.claude/rules/
> cp -r SI-Claude-Plugin/rules/php ~/.claude/rules/
>
> # Option C: Manual rules install — project-level (applies to current project only)
> mkdir -p .claude/rules
> cp -r SI-Claude-Plugin/rules/common .claude/rules/
> cp -r SI-Claude-Plugin/rules/typescript .claude/rules/     # pick your stack
> ```

---

#### Hooks

Hooks are automatically registered when you install via plugin. The `session-start-plugin-sync.js` hook ensures they stay up to date as new plugin versions are released.

To add hooks manually, copy the entries from `hooks/hooks.json` into your `~/.claude/settings.json`.

#### Configure MCPs

Copy desired MCP server definitions from `mcp-configs/mcp-servers.json` into your official Claude Code config in `~/.claude/settings.json`, or into a project-scoped `.mcp.json` if you want repo-local MCP access.

If you already run your own copies of SICP-bundled MCPs, set:

```bash
export ECC_DISABLED_MCPS="github,context7,exa,playwright,sequential-thinking,memory"
```

SICP-managed install and Codex sync flows will skip or remove those bundled servers instead of re-adding duplicates.

**Important:** Replace `YOUR_*_HERE` placeholders with your actual API keys.

---

## Key Concepts

### Agents

Subagents handle delegated tasks with limited scope. Example:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Reviews code for quality, security, and maintainability
tools: ["Read", "Grep", "Glob", "Bash"]
model: opus
---

You are a senior code reviewer...
```

### Skills

Skills are the primary workflow surface. They can be invoked directly, suggested automatically, and reused by agents. SICP still ships `commands/` during migration, but new workflow development should land in `skills/` first.

```markdown
# TDD Workflow

1. Define interfaces first
2. Write failing tests (RED)
3. Implement minimal code (GREEN)
4. Refactor (IMPROVE)
5. Verify 80%+ coverage
```

### Hooks

Hooks fire on tool events. Example - warn about console.log:

```json
{
  "matcher": "tool == \"Edit\" && tool_input.file_path matches \"\\\\.（ts|tsx|js|jsx)$\"",
  "hooks": [{
    "type": "command",
    "command": "#!/bin/bash\ngrep -n 'console\\.log' \"$file_path\" && echo '[Hook] Remove console.log' >&2"
  }]
}
```

The `post-edit-standards.js` hook enforces coding standards automatically on every `Write|Edit|MultiEdit` event. It runs in the `standard` and `strict` `ECC_HOOK_PROFILE` profiles and degrades gracefully when a language tool is not installed:

| Language | Tool | Auto-fix applied | Critical violations blocked |
|----------|------|------------------|-----------------------------|
| TypeScript / JavaScript | ESLint | complexity, no-any, return types | complexity, no-any |
| PHP | PHPStan + PHP-CS-Fixer | PSR-12 style | type errors, undefined methods |
| Python | Ruff | formatting | C901 complexity, unused imports |
| Rust | cargo clippy + rustfmt | rustfmt | clippy::complexity |
| Shell / Bash | shellcheck | — | all errors |

To disable the hook for a session: `export ECC_DISABLED_HOOKS="post:edit:standards"`.

### Rules

Rules are always-follow guidelines, organized into `common/` (language-agnostic) + language-specific directories:

```
rules/
  common/          # Universal principles (always install)
  typescript/      # TS/JS specific patterns and tools
  python/          # Python specific patterns and tools
  golang/          # Go specific patterns and tools
  swift/           # Swift specific patterns and tools
  php/             # PHP specific patterns and tools
```

See [`rules/README.md`](rules/README.md) for installation and structure details.

## Which Agent Should I Use?

Not sure where to start? Use this quick reference. Skills are the canonical workflow surface; slash entries below are the compatibility form most users already know.

| I want to... | Use this command | Agent used |
|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Plan a new feature | `/SICP:plan "Add auth"` | planner |
| Design system architecture | `/SICP:plan` + architect agent | architect |
| Write code with tests first | `/tdd` | tdd-guide |
| Review code I just wrote | `/code-review` | code-reviewer |
| Fix a failing build | `/build-fix` | build-error-resolver |
| Run end-to-end tests | `/e2e` | e2e-runner |
| Find security vulnerabilities | `/security-scan` | security-reviewer |
| Remove dead code | `/refactor-clean` | refactor-cleaner |
| Update documentation | `/update-docs` | doc-updater |
| Review Go code | `/go-review` | go-reviewer |
| Review Python code | `/python-review` | python-reviewer |
| Review TypeScript/JavaScript code | *(invoke `typescript-reviewer` directly)* | typescript-reviewer |
| Audit database queries | *(auto-delegated)* | database-reviewer |

### Common Workflows

Slash forms below are shown because they are still the fastest familiar entrypoint. Under the hood, SICP is shifting these workflows toward skills-first definitions.

**Starting a new feature:**
```
/SICP:plan "Add user authentication with OAuth"
                                              → planner creates implementation blueprint
/tdd                                          → tdd-guide enforces write-tests-first
/code-review                                  → code-reviewer checks your work
```

**Fixing a bug:**
```
/tdd                                          → tdd-guide: write a failing test that reproduces it
                                              → implement the fix, verify test passes
/code-review                                  → code-reviewer: catch regressions
```

**Preparing for production:**
```
/security-scan                                → security-reviewer: OWASP Top 10 audit
/e2e                                          → e2e-runner: critical user flow tests
/test-coverage                                → verify 80%+ coverage
```

## FAQ

<details>
<summary><b>How do I check which agents/commands are installed?</b></summary>

```bash
/plugin list SI-Claude-Plugin@SI-Claude-Plugin
```

This shows all available agents, commands, and skills from the plugin.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My hooks aren't working / I see "Duplicate hooks file" errors</b></summary>

This is the most common issue. **Do NOT add a `"hooks"` field to `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.** Claude Code v2.1+ automatically loads `hooks/hooks.json` from installed plugins. Explicitly declaring it causes duplicate detection errors.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use SICP with Claude Code on a custom API endpoint or model gateway?</b></summary>

Yes. SICP does not hardcode Anthropic-hosted transport settings. It runs locally through Claude Code's normal CLI/plugin surface, so it works with:

- Anthropic-hosted Claude Code
- Official Claude Code gateway setups using `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` and `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`
- Compatible custom endpoints that speak the Anthropic API Claude Code expects

Minimal example:

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=https://your-gateway.example.com
export ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN=your-token
claude
```

If your gateway remaps model names, configure that in Claude Code rather than in SICP. SICP's hooks, skills, commands, and rules are model-provider agnostic once the `claude` CLI is already working.

Official references:
- [Claude Code LLM gateway docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/llm-gateway)
- [Claude Code model configuration docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/model-config)

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>My context window is shrinking / Claude is running out of context</b></summary>

Too many MCP servers eat your context. Each MCP tool description consumes tokens from your 200k window, potentially reducing it to ~70k.

**Fix:** Disable unused MCPs per project:
```json
// In your project's .claude/settings.json
{
  "disabledMcpServers": ["supabase", "railway", "vercel"]
}
```

Keep under 10 MCPs enabled and under 80 tools active.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Can I use only some components (e.g., just agents)?</b></summary>

Yes. Use Option 2 (manual installation) and copy only what you need:

```bash
# Just agents
cp SI-Claude-Plugin/agents/*.md ~/.claude/agents/

# Just rules
mkdir -p ~/.claude/rules/
cp -r SI-Claude-Plugin/rules/common ~/.claude/rules/
```

Each component is fully independent.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Does this work with Cursor / OpenCode / Codex / Antigravity?</b></summary>

Yes. SICP is cross-platform:
- **Cursor**: Pre-translated configs in `.cursor/`. See [Cursor IDE Support](#cursor-ide-support).
- **Gemini CLI**: Experimental project-local support via `.gemini/GEMINI.md` and shared installer plumbing.
- **OpenCode**: Full plugin support in `.opencode/`. See [OpenCode Support](#opencode-support).
- **Codex**: First-class support for both macOS app and CLI, with adapter drift guards and SessionStart fallback. See PR [#257](https://github.com/coreybowlby-os/SI-Claude-Plugin/pull/257).
- **Antigravity**: Tightly integrated setup for workflows, skills, and flattened rules in `.agent/`. See [Antigravity Guide](docs/ANTIGRAVITY-GUIDE.md).
- **Non-native harnesses**: Manual fallback path for Grok and similar interfaces. See [Manual Adaptation Guide](docs/MANUAL-ADAPTATION-GUIDE.md).
- **Claude Code**: Native — this is the primary target.
</details>

<details>
<summary><b>How do I contribute a new skill or agent?</b></summary>

---

## Cursor IDE Support

SICP provides **full Cursor IDE support** with hooks, rules, agents, skills, commands, and MCP configs adapted for Cursor's native format.

### Quick Start (Cursor)

```bash
# macOS/Linux
./install.sh --target cursor typescript
./install.sh --target cursor python golang swift php
```

```powershell
# Windows PowerShell
.\install.ps1 --target cursor typescript
.\install.ps1 --target cursor python golang swift php
```

### What's Included

| Component | Count | Details |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Hook Events | 15 | sessionStart, beforeShellExecution, afterFileEdit, beforeMCPExecution, beforeSubmitPrompt, and 10 more |
| Hook Scripts | 16 | Thin Node.js scripts delegating to `scripts/hooks/` via shared adapter |
| Rules | 34 | 9 common (alwaysApply) + 25 language-specific (TypeScript, Python, Go, Swift, PHP) |
| Agents | Shared | Via AGENTS.md at root (read by Cursor natively) |
| Skills | Shared + Bundled | Via AGENTS.md at root and `.cursor/skills/` for translated additions |
| Commands | Shared | `.cursor/commands/` if installed |
| MCP Config | Shared | `.cursor/mcp.json` if installed |

### Hook Architecture (DRY Adapter Pattern)

Cursor has **more hook events than Claude Code** (20 vs 8). The `.cursor/hooks/adapter.js` module transforms Cursor's stdin JSON to Claude Code's format, allowing existing `scripts/hooks/*.js` to be reused without duplication.

```
Cursor stdin JSON → adapter.js → transforms → scripts/hooks/*.js
                                              (shared with Claude Code)
```

Key hooks:
- **beforeShellExecution** — Blocks dev servers outside tmux (exit 2), git push review
- **afterFileEdit** — Auto-format + TypeScript check + console.log warning
- **beforeSubmitPrompt** — Detects secrets (sk-, ghp_, AKIA patterns) in prompts
- **beforeTabFileRead** — Blocks Tab from reading .env, .key, .pem files (exit 2)
- **beforeMCPExecution / afterMCPExecution** — MCP audit logging

### Rules Format

Cursor rules use YAML frontmatter with `description`, `globs`, and `alwaysApply`:

```yaml
---
description: "TypeScript coding style extending common rules"
globs: ["**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx", "**/*.js", "**/*.jsx"]
alwaysApply: false
---
```

---

## Codex macOS App + CLI Support

SICP provides **first-class Codex support** for both the macOS app and CLI, with a reference configuration, Codex-specific AGENTS.md supplement, and shared skills.

### Quick Start (Codex App + CLI)

```bash
# Run Codex CLI in the repo — AGENTS.md and .codex/ are auto-detected
codex

# Automatic setup: sync SICP assets (AGENTS.md, skills, MCP servers) into ~/.codex
npm install && bash scripts/sync-ecc-to-codex.sh
# or: pnpm install && bash scripts/sync-ecc-to-codex.sh
# or: yarn install && bash scripts/sync-ecc-to-codex.sh
# or: bun install && bash scripts/sync-ecc-to-codex.sh

# Or manually: copy the reference config to your home directory
cp .codex/config.toml ~/.codex/config.toml
```

The sync script safely merges SICP MCP servers into your existing `~/.codex/config.toml` using an **add-only** strategy — it never removes or modifies your existing servers. Run with `--dry-run` to preview changes, or `--update-mcp` to force-refresh SICP servers to the latest recommended config.

For Context7, SICP uses the canonical Codex section name `[mcp_servers.context7]` while still launching the `@upstash/context7-mcp` package. If you already have a legacy `[mcp_servers.context7-mcp]` entry, `--update-mcp` migrates it to the canonical section name.

Codex macOS app:
- Open this repository as your workspace.
- The root `AGENTS.md` is auto-detected.
- `.codex/config.toml` and `.codex/agents/*.toml` work best when kept project-local.
- The reference `.codex/config.toml` intentionally does not pin `model` or `model_provider`, so Codex uses its own current default unless you override it.
- Optional: copy `.codex/config.toml` to `~/.codex/config.toml` for global defaults; keep the multi-agent role files project-local unless you also copy `.codex/agents/`.

### Key Limitation

Codex does **not yet provide Claude-style hook execution parity**. SICP enforcement there is instruction-based via `AGENTS.md`, optional `model_instructions_file` overrides, and sandbox/approval settings.

### Multi-Agent Support

Current Codex builds support stable multi-agent workflows.

- Enable `features.multi_agent = true` in `.codex/config.toml`
- Define roles under `[agents.<name>]`
- Point each role at a file under `.codex/agents/`
- Use `/agent` in the CLI to inspect or steer child agents

SICP ships three sample role configs:

| Role | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `explorer` | Read-only codebase evidence gathering before edits |
| `reviewer` | Correctness, security, and missing-test review |
| `docs_researcher` | Documentation and API verification before release/docs changes |

---

## OpenCode Support

SICP provides **full OpenCode support** including plugins and hooks.

### Quick Start

```bash
# Install OpenCode
npm install -g opencode

# Run in the repository root
opencode
```

The configuration is automatically detected from `.opencode/opencode.json`.

### Feature Parity

| Feature | Claude Code | OpenCode | Status |
|---------|-------------|----------|--------|
| Agents | PASS: 47 agents | PASS: 12 agents | **Claude Code leads** |
| Commands | PASS: 79 commands | PASS: 31 commands | **Claude Code leads** |
| Skills | PASS: 195 skills | PASS: 37 skills | **Claude Code leads** |
| Hooks | PASS: 8 event types | PASS: 11 events | **OpenCode has more!** |
| Rules | PASS: 29 rules | PASS: 13 instructions | **Claude Code leads** |
| MCP Servers | PASS: 14 servers | PASS: Full | **Full parity** |
| Custom Tools | PASS: Via hooks | PASS: 6 native tools | **OpenCode is better** |

### Hook Support via Plugins

OpenCode's plugin system is MORE sophisticated than Claude Code with 20+ event types:

| Claude Code Hook | OpenCode Plugin Event |
|-----------------|----------------------|
| PreToolUse | `tool.execute.before` |
| PostToolUse | `tool.execute.after` |
| Stop | `session.idle` |
| SessionStart | `session.created` |
| SessionEnd | `session.deleted` |

**Additional OpenCode events**: `file.edited`, `file.watcher.updated`, `message.updated`, `lsp.client.diagnostics`, `tui.toast.show`, and more.

### Plugin Installation

**Option 1: Use directly**
```bash
cd SI-Claude-Plugin
opencode
```

**Option 2: Install as npm package**
```bash
npm install sicp
```

Then add to your `opencode.json`:
```json
{
  "plugin": ["sicp"]
}
```

That npm plugin entry enables SICP's published OpenCode plugin module (hooks/events and plugin tools).
It does **not** automatically add SICP's full command/agent/instruction catalog to your project config.

For the full SICP OpenCode setup, either:
- run OpenCode inside this repository, or
- copy the bundled `.opencode/` config assets into your project and wire the `instructions`, `agent`, and `command` entries in `opencode.json`

### Documentation

- **Migration Guide**: `.opencode/MIGRATION.md`
- **OpenCode Plugin README**: `.opencode/README.md`
- **Consolidated Rules**: `.opencode/instructions/INSTRUCTIONS.md`
- **LLM Documentation**: `llms.txt` (complete OpenCode docs for LLMs)

## Cross-Tool Feature Parity

SICP is the **first plugin to maximize every major AI coding tool**. Here's how each harness compares:

| Feature | Claude Code | Cursor IDE | Codex CLI | OpenCode |
|---------|------------|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Agents** | 47 | Shared (AGENTS.md) | Shared (AGENTS.md) | 12 |
| **Commands** | 79 | Shared | Instruction-based | 31 |
| **Skills** | 195 | Shared | 10 (native format) | 37 |
| **Hook Events** | 8 types | 15 types | None yet | 11 types |
| **Hook Scripts** | 20+ scripts | 16 scripts (DRY adapter) | N/A | Plugin hooks |
| **Rules** | 34 (common + lang) | 34 (YAML frontmatter) | Instruction-based | 13 instructions |
| **Custom Tools** | Via hooks | Via hooks | N/A | 6 native tools |
| **MCP Servers** | 14 | Shared (mcp.json) | 7 (auto-merged via TOML parser) | Full |
| **Config Format** | settings.json | hooks.json + rules/ | config.toml | opencode.json |
| **Context File** | CLAUDE.md + AGENTS.md | AGENTS.md | AGENTS.md | AGENTS.md |
| **Secret Detection** | Hook-based | beforeSubmitPrompt hook | Sandbox-based | Hook-based |
| **Auto-Format** | PostToolUse hook | afterFileEdit hook | N/A | file.edited hook |
| **Version** | Plugin | Plugin | Reference config | 1.10.0 |

**Key architectural decisions:**
- **AGENTS.md** at root is the universal cross-tool file (read by all 4 tools)
- **DRY adapter pattern** lets Cursor reuse Claude Code's hook scripts without duplication
- **Skills format** (SKILL.md with YAML frontmatter) works across Claude Code, Codex, and OpenCode
- Codex's lack of hooks is compensated by `AGENTS.md`, optional `model_instructions_file` overrides, and sandbox permissions

## Token Optimization

Claude Code usage can be expensive if you don't manage token consumption. These settings significantly reduce costs without sacrificing quality.

### Recommended Settings

Add to `~/.claude/settings.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "sonnet",
  "env": {
    "MAX_THINKING_TOKENS": "10000",
    "CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE": "50"
  }
}
```

| Setting | Default | Recommended | Impact |
|---------|---------|-------------|--------|
| `model` | opus | **sonnet** | ~60% cost reduction; handles 80%+ of coding tasks |
| `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` | 31,999 | **10,000** | ~70% reduction in hidden thinking cost per request |
| `CLAUDE_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT_OVERRIDE` | 95 | **50** | Compacts earlier — better quality in long sessions |

Switch to Opus only when you need deep architectural reasoning:
```
/model opus
```

### Daily Workflow Commands

| Command | When to Use |
|---------|-------------|
| `/model sonnet` | Default for most tasks |
| `/model opus` | Complex architecture, debugging, deep reasoning |
| `/clear` | Between unrelated tasks (free, instant reset) |
| `/compact` | At logical task breakpoints (research done, milestone complete) |
| `/cost` | Monitor token spending during session |

### Strategic Compaction

The `strategic-compact` skill (included in this plugin) suggests `/compact` at logical breakpoints instead of relying on auto-compaction at 95% context. See `skills/strategic-compact/SKILL.md` for the full decision guide.

**When to compact:**
- After research/exploration, before implementation
- After completing a milestone, before starting the next
- After debugging, before continuing feature work
- After a failed approach, before trying a new one

**When NOT to compact:**
- Mid-implementation (you'll lose variable names, file paths, partial state)

### Context Window Management

**Critical:** Don't enable all MCPs at once. Each MCP tool description consumes tokens from your 200k window, potentially reducing it to ~70k.

- Keep under 10 MCPs enabled per project
- Keep under 80 tools active
- Use `disabledMcpServers` in project config to disable unused ones

### Agent Teams Cost Warning

Agent Teams spawns multiple context windows. Each teammate consumes tokens independently. Only use for tasks where parallelism provides clear value (multi-module work, parallel reviews). For simple sequential tasks, subagents are more token-efficient.

---

### Customization

This plugin is a starting point. You should:
1. Start with what resonates with your workflow
2. Modify for your stack and project-specific patterns
3. Remove what you don't use
4. Add your own patterns via a PR
